# Gardener

Gardener allows users to have all the information for their garden in one place! Users can also see how current & prospective plants will fair within their hardiness zone.

## Motivation

I built Gardener because I find it difficult to remember every need for all of my plants, which results in endless, repetitive web searches. Finally, all of my garden information can be in one place!

Or so I thought... Unfortunately, the Trefle plant database is fairly new & therefor lackluster: common plants don't have enough data, not all plants have images, & some useful information (shade tolerance, toxicity, watering frequency, etc) are temporarily missing.

Rosemary, Blackwood, Apple, Mango, Papaya, Guava, Sweetgale, & Redwood are good examples to test functionality.
